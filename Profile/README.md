Network Upgrade Proposal for InnovateTech: A Deep Dive by NPV
Executive Summary:
This proposal outlines a comprehensive network upgrade solution for InnovateTech. We are awry of your your growing workforce, expanding security needs. This of course comes with  increasing demand for collaboration and remote access in a post Covid environment. We propose a two-pronged approach: enhancing your current existing physical infrastructure with robust security features with future plans to migrate key services to a secure and scalable AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. This hybrid approach optimizes network performance, strengthens data security, streamlines collaboration, and positions your company for future growth.
Current Challenges:
Data Security Concerns: The lack of departmental segregation exposes sensitive data to unauthorized access, increasing vulnerability to cyberattacks and potential data breaches.
Collaboration Bottlenecks: Limited file sharing capabilities hinder workflow across departments, impacting productivity and employee satisfaction.
Scalability Constraints: The current network infrastructure struggles to accommodate your expanding workforce and growing resource demands.
Remote Access Gaps: The absence of secure remote access options restricts flexibility and limits talent acquisition opportunities.
Proposed Solution Phase 1:
1. Enhanced Physical Network:
Departmental VLANs: We will implement VLANs (Virtual LANs) to create isolated network segments for each department (Sales & Marketing, R&D, IT). This segregates traffic, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and enhancing overall security. Imagine each department having its own secure “neighborhood” within the network city.
Benefits:
Improved security posture through data isolation.
Reduced network congestion and faster data transfer.
Simplified network management for each department.
Advanced Security Features: We will upgrade core switches and access points with firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and endpoint security solutions. This creates a multi-layered defense perimeter against cyber threats. Imagine an additional wall and security guards around each departmental neighborhood.
Benefits:
Proactive threat detection and mitigation.
Protection against malware, ransomware, and other cyberattacks.
Enhanced device-level security for all connected endpoints.
Secure VPN Access: We will establish a VPN server, enabling secure remote access for authorized employees. This ensures secure data transmissions from any location while maintaining network integrity. Imagine a secure tunnel employees can use to travel safely between the office and the network city.
Benefits:
Increased employee flexibility and work-life balance.
Improved talent acquisition opportunities by attracting remote candidates.
Secure remote access to company resources for authorized users.
Proposed Solution Phase 2:
2. Secure and Scalable AWS VPC:
Web-Based Login and Virtualized desktops:
We will implement a we-based login portal for employees, enabling secure access to their virtualized desktop environments from any device with an internet connection. This eliminates the need for traditional desktop computers and simplifies device management
Imagine employees using a virtual “key” to unlock their secure workspace within a cloud city, accessible from anywhere
Benefits:
Enhanced mobility and flexibility for employees
Improved security through centralized management and data protection
Reduced hardware cost and maintenance overhead
Improved disaster recovery capabilites 
We will integrate multi-factor authentication (MFA) with the we-based login to strengthen security. This requires users to provide multiple credentials (e.g., password, security token, or biometric verification), Making unauthorized access even more difficult
Imagine requiring employees to present virtual “ID cards” along with their key to access the cloud city adding an extra layer of protection.
Benefits:
Protection against unauthorized access and credential theft. 
Compliance with industry security standards. 
Reduced risk of data breaches.
Private Subnets for Departmental VMs: We will migrate key services to dedicated private subnets within the AWS VPC for each department. This isolates your data and resources within a secure virtual environment, separate from the public internet. Imagine each department having its own secure “datacenter” within the cloud city.
Benefits:
Enhanced data protection through isolation from public internet.
Scalability to accommodate future growth without impacting existing infrastructure.
Simplified management and resource control for each department.
Centralized File Share and Active Directory: We will deploy a dedicated file server VM with Active Directory integration within the VPC. This facilitates secure and organized file sharing across departments, boosting collaboration and efficiency. Imagine each department having a secure “shared storage facility” within the cloud city, accessible only to authorized users.
Benefits:
Streamlined file access and collaboration across departments.
Centralized user and group management for efficient access control.
Improved project workflow and team productivity.
Public Subnet and NAT Gateway: A public subnet will host public-facing resources like the website or email server, while a NAT Gateway provides secure internet access for private subnet instances. This ensures public resources are easily accessible while protecting internal data. Imagine a designated “marketplace” in the cloud city where authorized users can access public resources while the inner city remains secure.
Benefits:
Seamless access to public resources without compromising internal security.
Cost-effective way to utilize internet resources for specific services.
Flexible and scalable public resource deployment.
Future Expansion Subnet: A dedicated subnet within the VPC will be reserved for future expansion. This allows seamless integration of new departments or resources without affecting existing infrastructure. Imagine a designated “construction zone” in the cloud city where you can build new neighborhoods without disrupting the existing ones.
Benefits:
Future-proof network architecture for ongoing growth.
Simplified integration of new resources without network reconfiguration.
Scalability to accommodate unforeseen departmental additions.
Implementation Timeline and Budget:
The project is estimated to be completed within 6 months at an approximate cost of $75,000. We propose a phased implementation, prioritizing critical upgrades and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. We will provide detailed timelines and cost
